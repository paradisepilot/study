\subsection{Mechanism}

\textbf{Goal:} Bob wants to send Alice an encrypted message via an insecure channel.
\begin{itemize}
\item	Alice and Bob choose and publish a large prime $p$ and an integer $g$ with large prime order in $\F_{p}^{*}$.
\item	Alice chooses a secret $a \in \Z$, computes $A := g^{a} \mod p$, and sends $A \in\F_{p}^{*}$ to Bob
		via the insecure channel.
\item	Bob chooses a secret $b \in \Z$, computes $B := g^{b} \mod p$, and sends $B \in\F_{p}^{*}$ to Alice
		via the insecure channel.
\item	Bob computes $A^{b} = (g^{a})^{b} = g^{ab} \in \F_{p}^{*}$.
\item	Alice computes $B^{a} = (g^{b})^{a} = g^{ab} \in \F_{p}^{*}$.
\item	Alice and Bob have both arrived at $g^{ab} \in \F_{p}^{*}$, which is to be their shared secret.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange system}

\begin{itemize}
\item	The presumed security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange system is based on the presumed difficulty in solving the
		\begin{center}
		\begin{minipage}{0.80\textwidth}
		\textbf{The Diffie-Hellman Problem}: \vskip 0.1cm
		Let $p$ be a prime, and $g\in\F_{p}^{*}$.
		Given $A,B \in \langle\,g\,\rangle \subset \F_{p}^{*}$, find $g^{ab} \in \F_{p}^{*}$,
		where $a, b \in \Z$ are determined by $A = g^{a}$ and $B = g^{b}$.
		\end{minipage}
		\end{center}
		Note that the solution of the Diffie-Hellman problem does NOT require the knowledge of $a$ and $b$, but only
		that of $g^{ab} \in \langle\,g\,\rangle$.
\item	It is clear that an efficient algorithm for the Discrete Logarithm Problem will lead to an efficient algorithm for
		the Diffie-Hellman Problem. An efficient algorithm of the Discrete Logarithm Problem will break the
		Diffie-Hellman key exchange system.
		\begin{center}
		\begin{minipage}{0.80\textwidth}
		\textbf{The Discrete Logarithm Problem}: \vskip 0.1cm
		Let $p$ be a prime, and $g\in\F_{p}$ be a primitive element, i.e. $\F_{p}^{*} = \langle\,g\,\rangle$.
		Given any $h \in \F_{p}^{*}$, find $x \in \Z$ such that $h = g^{x}$.
