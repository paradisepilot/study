\begin{itemize}
\item
	Core encryption map:
	\begin{equation*}
	E : \Sigma^{n} \times \mathcal{K} \longrightarrow \Sigma^{n}\,
	\end{equation*}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
		$\Sigma$ is a finite set, and serves as the alphabet of the plain texts as well as cipher texts.
	\item
		$n \in \N$ is the block size
	\item
		$\mathcal{K}$ is a finite set, and serves as the key space.
	\item
		For each key $k \in \mathcal{K}$, the map
		\begin{equation*}
		E(\,\cdot\,,k) : \Sigma^{n} \longrightarrow \Sigma^{n}
		\end{equation*}
		is a bijection.
		Each $E(\,\cdot\,,k)$ bijectively maps strings of characters in $\Sigma$ of length $n \in \N$
		to strings of characters in $\Sigma$ of length $n$.
